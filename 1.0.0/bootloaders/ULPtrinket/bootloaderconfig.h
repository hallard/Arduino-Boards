/* Modified by me@frank-zhao.com for project VUSBtinyBoot
 *  
 * VUSBtinyBoot is a bootloader that emulates a USBtinyISP (from Adafruit Industries)
 *  
 * Trinket Pro will use VUSBtinyBoot
 *
 * This code is heavily derived from USBaspLoader, but also from USBtiny, with USBtinyISP's settings

General Description:
This file (together with some settings in Makefile) configures the boot loader
according to the hardware.

/* ---------------------------- Hardware Config ---------------------------- */

#define USB_CFG_IOPORTNAME      D
/* This is the port where the USB bus is connected. When you configure it to
 * "B", the registers PORTB, PINB and DDRB will be used.
 */
#define USB_CFG_DMINUS_BIT      4
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D- line is connected.
 * This may be any bit in the port.
 */
#define USB_CFG_DPLUS_BIT       2
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D+ line is connected.
 * This may be any bit in the port. Please note that D+ must also be connected
 * to interrupt pin INT0!
 */
#define USB_CFG_CLOCK_KHZ       (F_CPU/1000)
/* Clock rate of the AVR in MHz. Legal values are 12000, 16000 or 16500.
 * The 16.5 MHz version of the code requires no crystal, it tolerates +/- 1%
 * deviation from the nominal frequency. All other rates require a precision
 * of 2000 ppm and thus a crystal!
 * Default if not specified: 12 MHz
 */

/* ----------------------- Optional Hardware Config ------------------------ */

/* #define USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORTNAME   D */
/* If you connect the 1.5k pullup resistor from D- to a port pin instead of
 * V+, you can connect and disconnect the device from firmware by calling
 * the macros usbDeviceConnect() and usbDeviceDisconnect() (see usbdrv.h).
 * This constant defines the port on which the pullup resistor is connected.
 */
/* #define USB_CFG_PULLUP_BIT          4 */
/* This constant defines the bit number in USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORT (defined
 * above) where the 1.5k pullup resistor is connected. See description
 * above for details.
