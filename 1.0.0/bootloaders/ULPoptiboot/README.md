ULPoptiboot
===========

Custom Optiboot for Ultra Low Power Wireless Arduino Node  
You can find all technical and detailed information on my [blog][2]  

The added code will result in a compiled size of just under 1kb  
(Originally Optiboot is under 0.5kb)

##Features
List of features implemented in this version:

- Designed Ultra Low Power Wireless Node
- Power OFF Wireless Radio Module at boot
- Power OFF Sensors at boot
- Direct boot to application Sketch (no wait)
- Entering Bootloading only by pressing Wake switch or when FTDI Adapter is connected
- Default Arduino LED replaced by WS2812B RGB LED
- Included driver for WS2812(B) LED
- Exporting function to drive the WS2812(B) LED (or a strip) from Arduino Sketch

This is an initial release, it could contain bugs, but works fine for now. Please let me know if you find issues.

###Installation
Copy the content of the ULPoptiboot folder into a new folder in your Arduino bootloaders folder  
I copied mine at : arduino-install-dir\hardware\arduino\bootloaders\ulpnode\  
Backup the original files before overwrite all files.  
make ulpnode  

###Possible issues
- None for now

##Blog dedicated post
See this [post][3] for detailed information

##Why
- To reduce consumption in Ultra Low Power Node
- To be able do drive RGB LED
